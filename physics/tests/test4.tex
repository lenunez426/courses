\question
While building the pyramid of Giza, eight people accelerate a 2300-kg block of limestone to \SI{0.800}{m/s^2}, overcoming \SI{3000}{N} of friction. Assume each individual applies the same force. What is magnitude of the force applied by each person? (\textit{Hint}: Draw a free-body diagram.)

\begin{solution}
\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Known}: $a = \SI{0.800}{m/s^2}$, $m = \SI{2300}{kg}$, friction $f = \SI{3000}{N}$. 

\textbf{Unknown}: Individually applied force $F =$ ?

\vspace{1em}

By the vector sum in the free-body diagram,

\begin{equation*}
    F_{\mathrm{net}} = 8F - f\ ,
\end{equation*}

and by Newton's 2nd law (Eq.~4.4),

\begin{equation*}
    F_{\mathrm{net}} = m a = \SI{1840}{N}\ ,
\end{equation*}

implying that

\begin{equation*}
     8F - f = ma\ .
\end{equation*}

Solving for force,

\begin{equation*}
    F = \frac{ma + f}{8} = \SI{605}{N}\ .

\textbf{Instructions and Advice}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{0.1ex}
    \item Show your work and answers on separate sheets of paper. Staple those sheets to this one. Although you don't need to staple extra scratch paper that you used for side calculations or brainstorming, your final product should be a detailed and organized solution of the problems.
    \item Start early. You'll probably have questions. Some problems are similar to those we cover in class. Review your class notes as you work on these problems.
    \item When in doubt, employ the GUESS method: Write the known quantities, the unknown, and equation(s) relating the known and unknown. Solve equations for the unknown. Substitute numbers at the \textit{end} of a problem.
    \item Use Desmos (available at \href{https://www.desmos.com/scientific}{https://www.desmos.com/scientific}).
    \item Don't give up on a problem without trying your best. Ask Mr.~Nunez and your peers for help.
    \item Keep in mind that future quizzes and tests are based in part on these problem sets. You should use these practice problems as a study guide.
    \item Write solutions that will make sense to \textit{you} one week from today.
    \item Practice makes you better. Re-visit these problems even after you solve them. Solving problems without looking at your notes will refine your problem-solving skills.
\end{enumerate}
