    What is projectile motion?
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
        \item Projectile motion is the motion of an object projected into the air and moving under the influence of gravity.
        \item Projectile motion is the motion of an object projected into the air and moving independently of gravity.
        \item Projectile motion is the motion of an object projected vertically upward into the air and moving under the influence of gravity.
        \item Projectile motion is the motion of an object projected horizontally into the air and moving independently of gravity.
