\section{Two-Dimensional Motion Application}

In this unit, we explore two types of two-dimensional motion: projectile motion and uniform circular motion (UCM). The first 10 lessons address projectile motion; the last 8 lessons, UCM.

\Gls{projectile motion} is the motion of an object thrown (projected) into the air when, after the initial force that launches the object, air resistance is negligible and the only other force that object experiences is the force of gravity. The object is called a \gls{projectile}, and its path is called its \gls{trajectory}. \Gls{air resistance} is a frictional force that slows its motion and can significantly alter the trajectory of the motion. Due to the difficulty in calculation, only situations in which the deviation from projectile motion is negligible and \textit{air resistance can be ignored} are considered in this unit. That approximation is often quite accurate.

Watch as Rickie strikes a golf ball at over \SI{144}{mph}, causing the ball to reach a height of over \SI{100}{ft}! Video producers have added a red curve for viewers to track the path of the golf ball. This curve, which we will see many time in this unit, is known as a \textcolor{csOrange}{trajectory}, and the ball is under going \textcolor{csOrange}{projectile motion}, a type of two-dimensional motion.

When you press the \texttt[red]{Fire} button, a projectile is launched through the air. The path of the projectile, which is indicated by the blue curve, is called the trajectory. Three points on the trajectory are worth mentioning. First, the origin is where the cannon is positioned. Second, the \gls{apex}, or maximum height, is the point at which the projectile reaches its largest vertical displacement. Third, maximum range occurs when the projectile impacts the ground. The \texttt[red]{Tool \#1} measures time, range, and height at several points on the path of the projectile. \texttt[red]{Time} is the time elapsed since the launch of the projectile, \texttt[red]{Range} is the projectile's horizontal displacement from the origin, and \texttt[red]{Height} is the projectile's vertical displacement from the origin.

\textbf{Part I: Measuring Time, Range, and Height}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Click the \texttt[red]{Fire} button to launch a cannonball from the cannon. Observe that the path of the projectile is indicated by the blue curve. A projectile's path is called the trajectory.
    \item Draw a sketch of the trajectory. 
    \item \label{VSHLLm} Use \texttt[red]{Tool \#1} to measure time, range, and height data throughout the trajectory at 0.4-second time intervals. In other words, at times $t=\SI{0.0}{s}$, \SI{0.4}{s}, \SI{0.8}{s}, \ldots, \SI{3.6}{s}. Label your data on the sketch from Step \ref{VSHLLm}.
    \item Record time, range, and height at these three points: the origin, at maximum height, and at maximum range.
\end{enumerate}



\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Part II: How Mass Affects Projectile Path}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The \texttt[red]{Reset} button ($\boldsymbol{\circlearrowleft}$) is located at the bottom right corner. It resets all settings to the default, as you found the page when you first opened it. Click the $\boldsymbol{\circlearrowleft}$ button.
    \item Click the \texttt[red]{Fire} button to launch a cannonball. Observe the same path, or trajectory, as before.
    \item \label{thVv3G} The default mass of the cannonball is \SI{17.60}{kg}. Change the mass to \SI{3.00}{kg}, and fire the cannon again. Did the trajectory change? Record your observations. 
    \item Repeat Step \ref{thVv3G} using the following projectile masses: $m=\SI{10}{kg}$, \SI{25}{kg}, and \SI{31}{kg}. Record your observations for each case. Then answer the following question: How does changing the mass of a projectile affect its path?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Part III: How Launch Height Affects Projectile Path}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Click the \texttt[red]{Reset} ($\boldsymbol{\circlearrowleft}$) button.
    \item Click the \texttt[red]{Fire} button, noting the familiar trajectory in blue.
    \item Locate the cannon at the origin. The values \SI{0}{m} and \ang{80} next to the cannon indicate that the projectile is set to be launched from a height of zero meters and at angle of \ang{80} from the horizontal.
    \item Locate the $\boldsymbol{+}$ symbol on the center of the cannon. Clicking and dragging this symbol upwards increases the launch height of the projectile. Change the launch height to 3 meters, fire the projectile at this height, and observe the new projectile path. Record your observations.
    \item Click-and-drag the $\boldsymbol{+}$ to change the launch height from 0 to 15 meters in increments of 3. In other words, from launch heights of \SI{0}{m}, \SI{3}{m}, \SI{6}{m}, \ldots, \SI{15}{m}. At each launch height, \texttt[red]{Fire} the projectile to observe the new trajectory. Record all your observations. 
    \item How does changing the launch height affect the path of a projectile? You may draw several sketches and use time, range, and height data from \texttt[red]{Tool \#1} to support your answer.

\begin{hook}
    Imagine being able to launch a water balloon from the roof of a building and accurately hit a target on the ground. In today's physics class, we'll explore the principles of projectile motion that will allow us to see the exact path that a projectile, like a water balloon, will take.
\end{hook}

\begin{warmup}
    Just like yesterday, access the \texttt[csOrange]{PhET Simulation} ``Projectile Motion'' (\href{https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/projectile-motion/latest/projectile-motion_all.html}{click here}). Click the \texttt[csOrange]{Lab} panel. Locate the following three functions on your screen: the fire button, the first measuring tool, and the reset button, which are displayed below. Set a timer for 5 minutes, and allow free exploration of this page.
\end{warmup}

\textbf{Part IV: How Launch Velocity Changes Projectile Path}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Click $\boldsymbol{\circlearrowleft}$ to reset all settings.
    \item \texttt[red]{Fire} the projectile at the default settings and observe the now-familiar trajectory. 
    \item By default, the cannon is set to fire the projectile with an initial speed (or velocity) of 18 meters per second. Decrease the velocity to \SI{12}{m/s}, \texttt[red]{Fire} the projectile, and observe the new projectile path.
    \item Increase the speed to \SI{24}{m/s}, \texttt[red]{Fire} the projectile, and observe the new trajectory.
    \item What initial speed causes the projectile to land closest to the bullseye (all other factors being equal)?
    \item How does changing launch velocity affect the path of a projectile? Draw sketches and reference time, range, and height data from \texttt[red]{Tool \#1} to support your answer.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1em}

\clearpage

\textbf{Part V: Launch Angle, Trajectory, and Hang Time}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Click $\boldsymbol{\circlearrowleft}$ to reset all settings.
    \item Click-and-drag near the barrel-end of the cannon (away from the $\boldsymbol{+}$ sign) to change the cannon's launch angle. Set the angle to \ang{30}, and don't change any other settings. Press \texttt[red]{Fire} to launch the cannonball. 
    \item Let's define \texttt[red]{hang time} as the total time elapsed between the launch of the projectile and the instant it strikes the ground. To measure hang time, locate the last data point on the trajectory (i.e., the blue curve), and use \texttt[red]{Tool \#1} to view the elapsed time at the end of the curve. Record the hang time.
    \item Increase the launch angle from \ang{30} to \ang{90} in increments of \ang{10}---in other words, as \ang{30}, \ang{40}, \ldots, \ang{90}. For each angle, record the projectile's hang time.
    \item How does changing the launch angle incrementally from \ang{30} to \ang{90} affect the shape of the trajectory, including maximum height and range?
    \item How does changing launch angles affect the hang time?  
    \item Which angle yields the largest possible maximum range? You may need to try launching the projectile at a variety of angles by trial-and-error to arrive at your conclusion.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Vertical \& Horizontal Vectors of Position, Velocity, and Acceleration \texttt[cpOrange]{(Wed 1/10/2024)}} \label{tMF7JY}

\begin{warmup}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Access the YouTube video ``Shoot-n-Drop'' (\href{https://youtu.be/zMF4CD7i3hg}{click here}) but don't play it yet. 
        \item Explain that this video shows one ball dropped vertically from rest and another one launched horizontally, with both objects being launched at the same time from the same height.
        \item Ask students to think about which ball will strike the ground first---the vertically dropped or the horizontally launched one?
        \item On the whiteboard, create four columns labeled as follows: vertically dropped, horizontally launched, not sure, other
        \item Give each student a sticky note. Set a 2 minute timer. Ask students to place their note under a column of their choice to represent their prediction. Take volunteers to explain their predictions, especially students in the ``other'' category.
    \end{itemize}
\end{warmup}

\begin{hook}
    Show the ``Shoot-n-Drop'' video from the Warm-Up (\href{https://youtu.be/zMF4CD7i3hg}{click here}). Have students Think-Pair-Share about why the two objects strike the ground at the same time. Steer the discussion towards the idea that vertical and horizontally motions in projectile motion are independent.
\end{hook}

\vspace{1em}

In Sections \ref{1hGIbN} and \ref{9UH4Uj} we launched projectiles at a variety of angles above the horizontal. A special case of projectile motion occurs when the object is launched from some height above ground at angle of \ang{0} with the horizontal. A \gls{horizontally launched projectile}, as we call it, is a projectile whose initial velocity is entirely in the horizontal direction, as its launch angle is zero. Such a projectile must be launched above ground-level so that the object may experience a drop. Figure \ref{lTQ6jX} represents a horizontally launched projectile. In Section \ref{Qxc2Cv}, we will show how to set-up and analyze problems related to horizontally launched projectiles.

\vspace{1em}

The most important concept in projectile motion is that when air resistance is ignored, horizontal and vertical motions are independent, meaning that they don't influence one another. Figure \ref{lTQ6jX} compares a cannonball in free fall (in red) to a cannonball launched horizontally in projectile motion (in black). You can see that \textit{the cannonball in free fall falls at the same rate as the cannonball in projectile motion}. Keep in mind that if the cannon launched the ball with any vertical component to the velocity, the vertical displacements would not line up perfectly.

\vspace{1em}

Since vertical and horizontal motions are independent, we can analyze them separately, along perpendicular axes. To do this, we separate projectile motion into the two components of its motion, one along the horizontal axis and the other along the vertical.

\subsection{Describing Vertical and Horizontal Motion \texttt[cpOrange]{(Thur 1/11/2024)}} \label{pW3BPZ}

\begin{hook}
    Divide the class into 2 groups placed on opposite sides of the room. Set a timer for 5 minutes. Allow students to make projectiles out of wads of paper. (Use paper of different colors for a creative touch.) Tell students to begin (safely) launching projectiles back and forth across the room to each other. Observe as the room begins teeming with parabolic trajectories. Require students to clean up the room when the timer goes off.
\end{hook}

\begin{warmup}
    List what you know about the following quantities---including, if applicable, their SI units. Then, list what you want to know about them in two-dimensional motion.

    \begin{center}
        \textbf{position} \hspace{2em}
        \textbf{velocity} \hspace{2em}
        \textbf{acceleration}
    \end{center}
\end{warmup}


As usual, we use velocity, acceleration, and displacement to describe motion. We must also find the components of these variables along the $x$- and $y$-axes. The components of acceleration are then very simple. In the vertical direction,

\begin{equation}
    a_y = -g = -\SI{10}{m/s^2}
\end{equation}

Note that this definition defines the upwards direction as positive. In the horizontal direction, because gravity is vertical only,

\begin{equation}
    a_x = 0
\end{equation}

Both accelerations are constant, so we can use the kinematic equations. For review, the kinematic equations from previous units are summarized below.

\begin{align}
    x &= x_0 + v_{\text{avg}} t\\[0.5ex]
    v_{\text{avg}} &= \frac{v_0 + v}{2}\\[0.5ex]
    v &= v_0 + a t\\[0.5ex]
    x &= x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2\\[0.5ex]
    v^2 &= v_0^2 + 2 a (x - x_0)
\end{align}

where $x$ is position, $x_0$ is initial position, $v$ is velocity, $v_{\text{avg}}$ is average velocity, $t$ is time, and $a$ is acceleration.

    \end{exercise}
\end{warmup}


The following four steps are used to analyze projectile motion:

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Step 1}: Know what each of the many variables means; see Table \ref{zvgNdH}. Recall that a variable is used to represent a physical quantity. The magnitudes of the displacement $d$ along $x$- and $y$-axes are called $x$ and  $y$. The magnitude of the velocity is $v$, and the magnitudes of the components of the velocity, $v_x$ and $v_y$, relate to $v$ also by the Pythagorean theorem. Initial values are denoted with a subscript 0.

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Step 2}: Treat the motion as two independent one-dimensional motions, one horizontal and the other vertical. The kinematic equations for horizontal motion take the following forms under the condition that horizontal acceleration is zero ($a_x = 0$):

\vspace{-1em}

\begin{align}
    x &= x_0 + v_x t \label{7fMAPG}\\[0.5ex]
    v_x &= v_{0x} = \text{velocity is a constant} \label{dCvDf4}
\end{align}

For vertical motion, the kinematic equations take the following forms under the condition that vertical acceleration is $a_y = -g = \SI{-10}{m/s^2}$:

\begin{align}
    y &= y_0 + \frac{1}{2}\left(v_{0y} + v_y\right)t\\[0.5ex]
    v_y &= v_{0y} - gt \label{SjYaoE} \\[0.5ex]
    y &= y_0 + v_{0y}t - \frac{1}{2}  g t^2  \label{36YuvF}
\end{align}

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Step 3}: Solve for the unknowns in the two separate motions (one horizontal and one vertical). Note that the only common variable between the motions is time $t$. The problem solving procedures here are the same as for one-dimensional kinematics.

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Step 4}: Recombine the two motions to find the total displacement $d$ and velocity $v$. These are related to their components via the Pythagorean theorem as shown below:

\begin{align}
    d &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \label{XvIie8} \\[0.5ex]
    v &= \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} \label{glASeI}
\end{align}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=csOrange]
    \textbf{Tips For Success}\\
    For problems of projectile motion, it is important to set up a coordinate system. The first step is to choose an initial position for $x$ and $y$. Usually, it is simplest to set the initial position of the object so that $x_0 = 0$ and $y_0 = 0$.

\begin{example} \label{ER19WG}
    Suppose the cannonball from Figure \ref{lTQ6jX} is launched horizontally from a height of \SI{12.0}{m} at a speed of \SI{18.0}{m/s}. How much time will it take the projectile to strike the ground?
\end{example}

\Solution Our strategy is based on the fact that the motion can be broken into horizontal and vertical motions in which $a_x = 0$ and $a_y = \SI{-10}{m/s^2}$. Start by drawing a sketch:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[width=7cm,height=7cm,
            ticks=none,
            xmin=0,xmax=32,
            ymin=0,ymax=15,
            clip=false,
            axis lines=left,
        ]
            \draw[RoyalBlue,domain=0:28.15,variable=\x,samples=100] plot(\x,{patheq(\x,12,18,0)}) node[black,below] {$t =\ ?$} node[black,below=4mm] {\StopWatchEnd}; 
            \fill (0,{patheq(0,12,18,0)}) circle (3pt) node[left=2pt] {$t_0 = 0$} node[below left=2mm] {\StopWatchStart};
            \draw[red,thick,->] (0,{patheq(0,12,18,0)}) -- ++(6,0) node[right] {\SI{18}{m/s}};
            \draw[<->,dashed] (1,0) -- ++(0,12) node[right,pos=0.5] {\SI{12}{m}};
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


Let's define given variables and the unknown. First, define initial positions as 

\begin{equation*}
    x_0 = \SI{0}{m} \quad \text{and} \quad y_0 = \SI{0}{m}
\end{equation*}

Thus, the cannonball's final vertical position will be

\begin{equation*}
    y = -\SI{12}{m}
\end{equation*}

(the negative sign indicating that the projectile will be displaced downwards at the moment of impact). In addition, if a projectile is horizontally launched, then the vertical component of its initial velocity is zero:

\begin{equation*}
    v_{0y} = 0
\end{equation*}

The unknown variable is time: $t =\ ?$ These given and unknown variables are related by Equation \eqref{36YuvF}:

\begin{equation*}
    y = y_0 + v_{0y}t - \frac{1}{2}  g t^2 
\end{equation*}

Substituting known and unknown values leads to

\begin{equation*}
    -12 = 0 + (0) t - \frac{1}{2} (10) t^2
\end{equation*}

or, more simply, to

\begin{equation*}
    -12 = -5 t^2
\end{equation*}

Furthermore, multiplying both sides by $-1$ results in the negative signs canceling out, leaving

\begin{equation*}
    12 = 5 t^2
\end{equation*}

To finish solving this equation for time ($t$), we take the following steps:

\begin{align*}
    \textbf{Write $t$ on left} \qquad & 5 t^2 = 12\\[1ex]
    \textbf{Divide by 5} \qquad & \frac{\cancel{5} t^2}{\textcolor{red}{\cancel{5}}} = \frac{12}{\textcolor{red}{5}}\\[1ex]
    \textbf{Simplify} \qquad & t^2 = \frac{12}{5}\\[1ex]
    \textbf{Compute} \qquad & t^2 = 2.4\\[1ex]
    \textbf{Take square root} \qquad & \sqrt{t^2} = \sqrt{2.4}\\[1ex]
    \textbf{Simplify} \qquad & t = 1.5
\end{align*}

Therefore, it takes the cannonball 1.5 seconds after being launched by the cannon to strike the ground below.

        \item \ang{90} or \ang{45}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{warmup}

\begin{example} \label{jKndVF}
    What is the range of the projectile from Example \ref{ER19WG}? (Calculate the horizontal displacement from its origin.)
\end{example}

\Solution In Example \ref{ER19WG}, we determined the initial position and hang time of the cannonball:

\begin{equation*}
    x_0 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad t = \SI{1.5}{s}
\end{equation*}

Also, we were given an initial horizontal velocity of \SI{18}{m/s}, and Equation \eqref{dCvDf4} implies that this horizontal velocity of the cannonball remains the same throughout the trajectory:

\begin{equation*}
    v_x = v_{0x} = \text{velocity is a constant} = \SI{18.0}{m/s}
\end{equation*}

The unknown variable is range, or horizontal displacement, which in this case is given by Equation \eqref{7fMAPG} as

\begin{equation*}
    x = x_0 + v_x t
\end{equation*}

Substituting given values leads to 

\begin{equation*}
    x = 0 + (\SI{18}{m/s})(\SI{1.5}{s}) = \SI{27}{m}
\end{equation*}

Therefore, the cannonball is horizontally displaced by 27 meters from its origin.

\endsolution

\begin{example}
    Calculate the magnitude of displacement at the instant the projectile strikes the ground, for the cannonball from Example \ref{ER19WG}.
\end{example}

\Solution In Examples \ref{ER19WG} and \ref{jKndVF}, we defined the cannonball's origin as $x_0 = 0$ and $y_0 = 0$, and we determined that the vertical and horizontal positions at the point of impact are

\begin{equation*}
    \quad x = \SI{27}{m} \quad \text{and} \quad y = \SI{-12}{m}

\begin{hook}
    Did you know that the physics governing the orbit of the Moon around Earth or of the planets around the Sun is fundamentally the same as projectile motion? In the 17th century, when Isaac Newton was formulating the laws of classical physics, he imagined a horizontally launched cannonball fired with a powerful cannon from the top of a mountain. At ordinary initial speeds, the cannonball's trajectory ends with it striking the ground. If the initial speed is extremely high, however, Newton hypothesized that the projectile will never strike the ground, because the Earth's surface will continually curve away from the trajectory. The projectile will be launched into orbit around Earth. This thought experiment is known as ``Newton's Cannon.''
\end{hook}

\begin{warmup}
    Share the link to simulation ``Newton's Cannon'' at \texttt[white]{physics.weber.edu} (\href{https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/software/NewtonsCannon.html}{click here}). Set a timer for 5 minutes, allowing students to freely explore and discuss this page.
\end{warmup}

\begin{example}
    Calculate the magnitude of velocity of the projectile from Example \ref{ER19WG} the instant it strikes the ground. This is known as the impact velocity.
\end{example}

\Solution In Example \ref{jKndVF}, we established that the horizontal component of the cannonball remains at the constant value of

\begin{equation*}
    v_x = \SI{18}{m/s}
\end{equation*}

throughout the trajectory; this is the same value as $v_{0x}$. The unknown we are looking for is magnitude of impact velocity, which is given by Equation \eqref{glASeI} as

\begin{equation*}
    v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}
\end{equation*}

Therefore, lets first calculate the vertical component of velocity at impact, $v_y$, which is given by Equation \eqref{SjYaoE} as

\begin{equation*}
    v_y = v_{0y} - gt
\end{equation*}

where $g = \SI{10}{m/s^2}$. A projectile that is horizontally launched implies that $v_{0y} = 0$. Also, in Example \ref{ER19WG}, we calculated the following hang time for the cannonball:

\begin{equation*}
    t = \SI{1.5}{s}
\end{equation*}

So, substituting known values into Equation \eqref{SjYaoE} leads to 

\begin{equation*}
    v_y = 0 - (\SI{10}{m/s^2})(\SI{1.5}{s}) = -\SI{15}{m/s} 
\end{equation*}

the negative sign indicating that vertical velocity is, as we expect, pointing downwards, towards the ground. Finally, substituting the given horizontal and vertical velocity components into Equation \eqref{glASeI} leads to

\begin{equation*}
    v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = \sqrt{\left(\SI{18}{m/s}\right)^2 + \left(-\SI{15}{m/s}\right)^2} = \SI{23}{m/s}
\end{equation*}

Therefore, the impact velocity is 23 meters per second, below and to the right.

\end{hook}

\begin{warmup}
    List 3 things you have learned about projectile motion, 2 examples of projectile motion, and 1 question you still have.
\end{warmup}

\begin{example}
    A firework shell is launched entirely vertically (at \ang{90}) from ground-level at an initial speed of \SI{45}{m/s}. What is the maximum height it will reach?
\end{example}

\Solution
Since this is a \textit{vertically} launched projectile, we will only analyze the shell's vertical motion, as no horizontal motion exists. 

\vspace{1em}


We are given initial velocity, $v_{0y} = \SI{45}{m/s}$, and we set the initial position at $y_0 = \SI{0}{m}$. The unknown we are looking for is height, which is given by Equation \eqref{36YuvF}:

\begin{equation*}
    y = y_0 + v_{0y}t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\end{equation*}

However, we don't know the time ($t$) to reach the top, so let's solve for it first. 

\vspace{1em}

Think about the following: What is the projectile's vertical velocity, $v_y$, at the top of its trajectory? We know that vertical velocity at maximum height is zero:

\begin{equation*}
    v_y = \SI{0}{m/s} \quad \text{(at maximum height)}
\end{equation*}

These known and unknown velocity quantities are related by Equation \eqref{SjYaoE}:

\begin{equation*}
    v_y = v_{0y} - gt
\end{equation*}

Substituting known values leads to 

\begin{equation*}
    0 = \SI{45}{m/s} - \left(\SI{10}{m/s^2}\right)\,t
\end{equation*}

Momentarily omitting units, we may solve for time as follows:

\begin{align*}
    \textbf{Add 10$t$} \qquad & 0 \redplus \textcolor{red}{10 t} = 45 - 10t \redplus \textcolor{red}{10 t}\\[0.5ex]
    \textbf{Simplify} \qquad & 10t = 45\\[0.5ex]
    \textbf{Divide by 10} \qquad & \frac{\cancel{10} t}{\textcolor{red}{\cancel{10}}} = \frac{45}{\textcolor{red}{10}}\\
    \textbf{Simplify} \qquad & t = \frac{45}{10}\\[0.5ex]
    \textbf{Compute} \qquad & t = 4.5
\end{align*}

Therefore, it takes this firework shell 4.5 seconds to reach its maximum height.

\subsection{Uniform Circular Motion} \label{uPOucv}
\subsubsection*{Centripetal Acceleration}

Circular motion is when an object moves in a circular path. Examples of circular motion include a race car speeding around a circular curve, a toy attached to a string swinging in a circle around your head, or the circular loop-the-loop on a roller coaster. The simplest case of circular motion is \gls{uniform circular motion}, where an object travels a circular path at a constant speed. Note that, unlike speed, the linear velocity of an object in circular motion is constantly changing because it is always changing direction. We know that acceleration is a change in velocity, either in magnitude or in direction or both. Therefore, an object undergoing uniform circular motion is always accelerating, even though the magnitude of its velocity is constant.

\vspace{1em}

You experience this acceleration yourself every time you ride in a car while it turns a corner. If you hold the steering wheel steady during the turn and move at a constant speed, you are executing uniform circular motion. What you notice is a feeling of sliding (or being flung, depending on the speed) away from the center of the turn. This isn't an actual force that is acting on you---it only happens because your body wants to continue moving in a straight line (as per Newton's first law) whereas the car is turning off this straight-line path. Inside the car it appears as if you are forced away from the center of the turn. This fictitious force is known as the \gls{centrifugal force}. The sharper the curve and the greater your speed, the more noticeable this effect becomes.

\captionof{figure}{Uniform circular motion, the radius of curvature and vectors for tangential velocity and centripetal acceleration. Compare this with the Ladybug Motion Simulation in Exercise \ref{N066SF}.}
\label{4QmpMJ}
\end{center}

Other examples of (approximate) uniform circular motion include the \href{https://youtu.be/3NYlYN-QTig}{hammer throw}, a bicyclist rounding a turn on a curved path, and the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The \gls{tangential velocity} ($\vec{v}$) is the instantaneous linear velocity of the object in circular motion. If the circular motion is abruptly cut off (as in the hammer throw sport), the object moves in a straight line in the direction of the tangential velocity. \Gls{tangential speed} is the magnitude of the tangential velocity, with no regard for the direction. The \gls{radius of curvature} ($r$) is the distance between the center of the circle and the path. We call the acceleration of an object moving in uniform circular motion the \gls{centripetal acceleration} ($a_c$) because centripetal means \textit{center seeking}.

\vspace{1em}

Now that we know that the direction of centripetal acceleration is toward the center of rotation, let's discuss the magnitude of centripetal acceleration. For an object traveling at speed $v$ in a circular path with radius $r$, the magnitude of centripetal acceleration is


\begin{equation} \label{5vsZ8y}
    a_{\text{c}} = \frac{v^2}{r}\ 
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{cl|cl}
    \hline
    \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Quantity} & \textbf{Unit} & \textbf{Unit Symbol}  \\
    \hline\hline
    \rule{0pt}{2.5ex}
        $a_{\text{c}}$ & centripetal acceleration & meter per second squared & \SI{}{m/s^2}\\
        $v$ & tangential speed & meter per second & \SI{}{m/s} \\
        $r$ & radius & meter & \SI{}{m}\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Centripetal acceleration is greater at high speeds and in sharp curves (smaller radius), as you may have noticed when driving a car, because the car actually pushes you toward the center of the turn. But it is a bit surprising that ac is proportional to the speed squared. This means, for example, that the acceleration is four times greater when you take a curve at \SI{20}{m/s} than at \SI{10}{m/s}.

\subsubsection*{Centripetal Force}

Because an object in uniform circular motion undergoes acceleration (by changing the direction of motion but not the speed), we know from Newton's second law of motion that there must be a net external force acting on the object. Since the magnitude of the acceleration is constant, so is the magnitude of the net force, and since the acceleration points toward the center of the rotation, so does the net force.

\vspace{1em}

Any force or combination of forces can cause a centripetal acceleration. Just a few examples are the tension in the rope on a tether ball, the force of Earth's gravity on the Moon, the friction between a road and the tires of a car as it goes around a curve, or the normal force of a roller coaster track on the cart during a loop-the-loop.

\vspace{1em}

The component of any net force that causes circular motion is called a \gls{centripetal force}. When the net force is equal to the centripetal force, and its magnitude is constant, uniform circular motion results. The direction of a centripetal force is toward the center of rotation, the same as for centripetal acceleration. According to Newton's second law of motion, a net force causes the acceleration of mass according to 

\begin{equation*}
    F_{\text{net}} = ma
\end{equation*}

For uniform circular motion, the acceleration is centripetal acceleration: 

\begin{equation*}
    a = a_c
\end{equation*}

Therefore, the magnitude of centripetal force, $F_c$, is $F_c = m a_c$. By using Equation \eqref{5vsZ8y} for the magnitude of centripetal acceleration, $a_c = v^2/r$, we get an expression involving the magnitude of the centripetal force in terms of tangential speed:

\begin{equation} \label{4H9EJq}
    F_c = m a_c = \frac{m v^2}{r}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{cl|cl}
    \hline
    \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Quantity} & \textbf{Unit} & \textbf{Unit Symbol}  \\
    \hline\hline
    \rule{0pt}{2.5ex}
        $F_{\text{c}}$ & centripetal force & newton & N\\
        $m$ & mass & kilogram & \SI{}{kg}\\
        $v$ & tangential speed & meter per second & \SI{}{m/s} \\
        $r$ & radius & meter & \SI{}{m}\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Newton's second law also states that the object will accelerate in the same direction as the net force. By definition, the centripetal force is directed towards the center of rotation, so the object will also accelerate towards the center. A straight line drawn from the circular path to the center of the circle will always be perpendicular to the tangential velocity. 

\begin{example}
    A car follows a curve of radius \SI{500}{m} at a speed of \SI{25.0}{m/s} (about \SI{56}{mph}). What is the magnitude of the car's centripetal acceleration?
\end{example}

\Solution We are given the radius of curvature and the tangential velocity:

\begin{equation*}
    r = \SI{500}{m} \quad \text{and} \quad v = \SI{25}{m/s}
\end{equation*}

The unknown is centripetal acceleration: $a_c =\ ?$. By Equation \eqref{5vsZ8y},

\begin{equation*}
    a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{25^2}{500} = 1.25 
\end{equation*}

The centripetal acceleration on the car is \SI{1.25}{m/s^2} (about 13\% of $g$, the acceleration due to gravity).

\endsolution

    What is the centripetal force exerted on a \SI{1600}{kg} car that rounds a \SI{100}{m} radius curve at \SI{12}{m/s}?
\end{example}

\Solution We are given mass, radius, and speed:

\begin{equation*}
    m = \SI{1600}{kg}\ , \quad 
    r = \SI{100}{m}\ , \quad
    v = \SI{12}{m/s}
\end{equation*}

The unknown is centripetal force: $F_c =\ ?$ The given and unknown values are related by Equation \eqref{4H9EJq}:

\begin{equation*}
    F_c = \frac{m v^2}{r} = \frac{(1600)(12^2)}{100} = 2304
\end{equation*}

The centripetal force is 2304 newtons inward.

\begin{exercise} \label{N066SF}
    Bring Figure \ref{4QmpMJ} to life by taking the following steps:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Access the OpenStax Simulations (\href{https://veillette.github.io/simulations/}{click here}).
        \item Click the simulation called ``Ladybug Motion.''
        \item Under \texttt[Green]{Vectors}, check the boxes for \texttt[Green]{Show Velocity} and \texttt[Green]{Show Acceleration}. 
        \item Towards the bottom, click \texttt[red]{Velocity}. Then, under \texttt[Green]{Remote Control}, drag the red button until you generate a red arrow about 1 centimeter in length. The Ladybug will start moving.
        \item When the Ladybug is in motion, locate the \texttt[Green]{Motion} options, and select \texttt[Green]{Circular}. The Ladybug is now undergoing uniform circular motion.
        \item Draw a sketch of the Ladybug and its velocity and acceleration vectors. Compare your sketch to Figure \ref{4QmpMJ}.

\ref{aVu3ZA}. Less force. In Equation~(\ref{4H9EJq}), radius (the length of the rope) is in the denominator of the fraction. This means that force and radius are \textit{inversely proportional}: if one goes up, the other goes down. By \textit{increasing} the radius (the length of the rope), the centripetal force must \textit{decrease}.
