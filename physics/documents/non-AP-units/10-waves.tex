\subsection{Introduction} \label{R3JSIu}

A \gls{wave} is a disturbance that moves from a source and carries energy. Light, sound, and ocean waves are common examples of waves. Waves \gls{propagate}, or move in a given direction. A \gls{mechanical wave} is a wave that requires a medium through which it can travel. The \gls{medium} is the solid, liquid, or gas material through which a wave propagates. 

\vspace{1em}

A \gls{transverse wave} is a wave in which the disturbance is \textit{perpendicular} to the direction of propagation.

\end{center}

There are several parts of a transverse wave. First we note that waves \gls{oscillate}, which means they move back and forth regularly between two points. The \gls{crest} is the highest position in the cycle of a wave. Likewise, the \gls{trough} is the lowest position in the cycle of a wave. The \gls{amplitude} is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position of a wave's segment oscillating around the equilibrium position. Amplitude is related to the wave's energy. You can think amplitude as the ``height'' of a crest. \Gls{wavelength} is the horizontal distance between \gls{adjacent}\footnote{Adjacent means ``next to''} identical parts of a wave. For convenience, you can measure wavelength as the distance between two adjacent crests. The distance between two adjacent troughs is also a wavelength.

\subsection{Period and Frequency} \label{BcrbfW}
Because waves are in motion and travel from one place to another, we can study them with respect to time. A stopwatch is helpful for the following exercise. 

\begin{example} \label{GlVTg1}
    Access the \texttt[red]{PhET Simulation} ``Waves on a String'' (\href{https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/wave-on-a-string}{click here}), to visualize the propagation of transverse waves. Then take the following steps.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
    \setlength\itemsep{0.1ex}
        \item Press the screen (on the play button) to start the simulation.
        \item Select the \texttt[red]{Oscillate} and \texttt[red]{No End} options.
        \item Increase \texttt[red]{Amplitude} to \SI{1.25}{cm}.
        \item Decrease \texttt[red]{Frequency} to \SI{0.50}{Hz}.
        \item Press the pause ({\tiny \faPause}) button at the instant the green bead on the end of the oscillating rod is at the highest point in the wave cycle (i.e. at the crest), as shown in Figure \ref{sAa4ih} below. Now press play ({\tiny \faPlay}) and observe this green bead travel from the crest, down to the trough, and back up to the crest. The amount of time it takes the bead to make this trip is known as the wave's \gls{period} of oscillation. 
        \item \label{82ffkH} Open the stopwatch app on your phone. Record 10 periods of the wave. In other words, measure the amount of time it takes the bead to make a 10 trips, each from crest, to trough, and back to crest. 
        \item \label{raDsYR} Divide the total time interval from the previous step by 10. The result is the average period of the wave as experimentally measurement by you.
        \item Repeat steps \ref{82ffkH} and \ref{raDsYR} for waves with frequencies of \SI{1.20}{Hz} and \SI{3.00}{Hz}. \textit{Note}: The higher the frequency, the more challenging it is for you to measure period.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    
\end{example}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=12cm]{figures/Unit11_PhET_Wave.png}
    \captionsetup{type=figure,margin=1in}
    \captionof{figure}{A screen shot from the ``Wave on a String'' \texttt{PhET Simulation}.}
    \label{sAa4ih}
\end{center}

\Solution For a wave with a frequency of \SI{0.50}{Hz}, the measured period is approximately 2 seconds. At frequencies of \SI{1.20}{Hz} and \SI{3.00}{Hz}, the periods are approximately \SI{0.8}{s} and \SI{0.3}{s}, respectively. You should notice that as the frequency of the wave increases, the period \textit{decreases}.

\solutionEnd

\vspace{1em}

Example \ref{GlVTg1} introduces two additional properties of waves: period and frequency. \Gls{period} is the time it takes to complete one wave cycle or oscillation. \Gls{frequency} is the number of wave cycles or oscillations completed in a time interval of 1 second. Period and frequency are \textit{inversely} related:

\begin{equation} \label{9WT68r}
    f = \frac{1}{T} \hspace{2em} 
    T = \frac{1}{f}
\end{equation}

By ``inversely'' related, we mean that as period increases, frequency decreases, and vice-verse. Period is measured in seconds. Frequency is measured in 1 over seconds, or Hertz (Hz). Thus, \SI{1}{Hz} is equivalent is 1/s.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{cl|cc}
    \hline
    \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Quantity} & \textbf{SI Base Unit} & \textbf{Unit Symbol}  \\
    \hline\hline
        $f$ & frequency & hertz & \si{\Hz}\\
        $T$ & period & second & s\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{example}
    A transverse wave completes 1 wave cycle every 0.25 seconds. What is the frequency of the wave?
\end{example}

\Solution We are given the period of the wave: $T = \SI{0.25}{s}$. By Equation \ref{9WT68r}, its frequency is

\begin{equation*}
    f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{0.25} = \SI{4}{\Hz}\ .
\end{equation*}

Therefore, this wave completes 4 wave cycles every second.

\solutionEnd

\begin{example}
    If a wave completes exactly $3 \frac{1}{3}$ wave cycles every second, what is the period of oscillation of the wave? 
\end{example}

\Solution We are given the wave's frequency as 3 and one-third hertz, or $f = 3\frac{1}{3}\,\text{Hz}$. This mixed number is written as an improper\footnote{See \href{https://openstax.org/books/prealgebra-2e/pages/4-1-visualize-fractions}{Section 4.1} of \textit{OpenStax: Prealgebra 2e} for a review on mixed numbers and improper fractions.} fraction as

\begin{equation*}
    3 \frac{1}{3} = \frac{10}{3} = 3.\overline{3}
\end{equation*}

So, the frequency is $f = \frac{10}{3}\,\text{Hz}$. The period, by Equation~\eqref{9WT68r}, is

\begin{equation*}
    T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{\frac{10}{3}} = \frac{3}{10}  = \SI{0.3}{s}
\end{equation*}

Therefore, it takes this wave 0.3 seconds to complete one wave cycle.

\subsection{Wave Velocity} \label{nkz8rf}
Waves \gls{propagate}, or move in a given direction from their source. \Gls{wave velocity} ($v$) is the speed at which a wave propagates. To calculate wave velocity, you need only two quantities:

\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{0.1ex}
    \item wavelength ($\lambda$)
    \item frequency ($f$)
\end{enumerate}

Wave velocity is frequency times wavelength:

\begin{equation} \label{UeynWL}
    v = f \lambda
\end{equation}


\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{cl|cc}
    \hline
    \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Quantity} & \textbf{SI Base Unit} & \textbf{Unit Symbol}  \\
    \hline\hline
        $v$ & wave velocity & meter per second & \si{\meter/\second}\\
        $f$ & frequency & hertz & \si{\Hz}\\
        $\lambda$ & wavelength & meter & m\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}

\end{center}

% \textit{PhET Simulation}: ``Waves Intro: Light'' (\href{https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/waves-intro/latest/waves-intro_en.html}{link})

\begin{example}
The frequency of a wave is 2.5 hertz, and its wavelength is 3.0 meters. Calculate the wave velocity.
\end{example}

\Solution We are given the frequency and wavelength: $f = \SI{2.5}{Hz}$ and $\lambda = \SI{3.0}{m}$. By Equation \eqref{UeynWL}, wave velocity is

\begin{equation*}
    v = f \lambda = (2.5)(3.0) = \SI{7.5}{m/s}
\end{equation*}

Thus, this wave moves at a speed of 7.5 meters per second.

\solutionEnd

\begin{example}
    The period of a wave is 0.78 seconds. Its wavelength is 1.1 meters. What is the wave's velocity?
\end{example}

\Solution We are given period and wavelength: $T = \SI{0.78}{s}$ and $\lambda = \SI{1.1}{m}$. The wave's frequency, by Equation \eqref{9WT68r}, is

\begin{equation*}
    f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{0.78} = \SI{1.28}{Hz}
\end{equation*}


Therefore, the wave velocity (Eq.~\ref{UeynWL}) is

\begin{equation*}
    v = f \lambda = (1.28)(1.1) = \SI{1.4}{m/s}
\end{equation*}

This wave travels at 1.4 meters per second.

    Access the \texttt[red]{PhET Simulation} ``Waves Intro'' (\href{https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/waves-intro/latest/waves-intro_en.html}{click here}). Click the \texttt[red]{Light} panel. 

    \begin{enumerate}
    \setlength\itemsep{0.1ex}
        \item Press the \texttt[green!60!black]{green} button on the laser to emit green light waves.
        \item Click and drag the ruler tool from the upper-right-hand corner to measure the horizontal distance from the center of one bright spot to the next. \textbf{Tip}: by default, the ruler is set the measure the wavelength of green light.
        \item Convert the given measurement from nanometers (nm) to meters (m), given that $\SI{1}{nm} = 10^{-9}\,\text{m}$.
        \item If the wave travels at a speed of 300 million meters per second (\SI{3e8}{m/s}), what is the frequency of the light wave? Express the answer both in scientific notation and in decimal notation.

\subsection{Superposition} \label{96T5dZ}

\begin{example} \label{OIqgoJ}
    Access the \texttt[red]{PhET Simulation} ``Waves on a String'' (\href{https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/wave-on-a-string}{click here}). Then take the following steps two create two pulses.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
    \setlength\itemsep{0.1ex}
        \item Press the screen (on the play button) to start the simulation.
        \item Select the \texttt[red]{Pulse} and \texttt[red]{Loose End} options.
        \item Increase the \texttt[red]{Amplitude} to \SI{1.25}{cm}.
        \item Decrease the \texttt[red]{Damping} to \texttt[red]{None}.
        \item Set the \texttt[red]{Tension} to the medium value.
        \item Click the green pulse button twice, with a 1-second gap between the two clicks.
        \item When the two pulses overlap on the same side of the equilibrium line (above or below it), what happens to the string?
        \item When the two pulses are on opposite sides---for example, if one pulse is above the equilibrium line, and the other is below---what happens to the string?
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=12cm]{figures/Unit11_PhET_Wave2.png}
    \end{center}
\end{example}

\Solution When two pulses converge on the same side of the equilibrium line, that portion of the string grows in height as the amplitudes of the two pulses add up. However, when pulses that are on opposite sides converge, the string momentarily flattens as the opposite amplitudes of the pulses cancel each other out.

The effect that we saw in Example \ref{OIqgoJ} is called superposition. \Gls{superposition} is the summation phenomenon that occurs when two waves arrive at the same point.

\textbf{\ref{gbJp6v}--\ref{OCQiEo}}. Consider two pulses on a string, one moving to the right, the other to the left. Each pulse moves at a rate of one unit grid per second. Draw the string at 1-second time intervals after the initial snapshot, using the principle of superposition to either add or subtract the amplitudes of the pulses when they overlap. \textit{Tip}: Use two colored pencils of different colors to shade the area under each pulse.

A \gls{longitudinal wave} is a wave in which the disturbance is \textit{parallel} to the direction of propagation. Although they are invisible, sound waves are a great example of longitudinal waves. \Gls{sound} is a disturbance of matter that is transmitted from its source outward by longitudinal waves. The solid, liquid, or gas material through which a sound waves propagates is called the \gls{medium}. For example, if sound propagates from a speaker through the air in a room, then air is the medium. If you could see the air particles in the room during the propagation of a sound wave, you would see something like what is shown in Figure \ref{kfXDSQ}.

%periodic variations

Sound waves cause a disturbance in the density and pressure of the surrounding air through which they propagate. What is density? \Gls{density} is the amount of matter or particles contained in a given region of space. If there are more air particles in a box, the region has a higher density compared to the same box with less particles, as shown below:

\Gls{pressure} is the force applied by air molecules over a given surface area. High-density regions of air exert more pressure than comparatively lower density regions. As seen in Figure \ref{kfXDSQ}, sound waves consists of periodic variations in air density---and, therefore, air pressure---and these variations propagate as longitudinal waves. A high-pressure (high-density) region of a sound wave is called a \gls{compression}, and a low-pressure region is called a \gls{rarefaction}. \Gls{atmospheric pressure} is the normal pressure of the air due to Earth's atmosphere, and compressions of a sound wave are slightly above atmospheric pressure. Rarefactions are below atemospheric pressure. 

\vspace{1em}

See the horizontal dashed line in Figure \ref{kfXDSQ}? If you plot the air pressure as a function of distance from the sound source across the dashed line, you get the plot shown in Figure \ref{6cfkhd} below. This ``gauge pressure'' is an excellent visualization of how a sound wave varies both above and below atmospheric pressure.
\vspace{1em}

% Standard atmospheric pressure is defined as $P_{\text{atm}} = \SI{1}{atm} = \SI{101.3}{kPa}$. Sound waves produce periodic variations slightly above and below atmospheric pressure. Periodic variations in pressure are shown below.

Noise-cancelling headphones (like AirPods) work by duplicating a sound wave of the external environment and shifting the duplicate out of phase with the original wave. In order words, the compressions of the original wave are perfectly aligned with the rarefactions of the duplicate. The duplicate may be called ``anti-noise,'' since, by superposition, it effectively cancels out the external sound. See Figure \ref{r1JrlI}.

We conclude with a note on the speed of sound. Sound speed depends on the medium. The speed of a sound wave propagating through air---the medium most commonly associated with sound---is 331 meters per second (about \SI{740}{mph}). Sound travels at different speeds through different media, like water, carbon dioxide, or glass. However, it does not propagate through a vacuum (i.e. empty space), since sound requires a medium through which the longitudinal wave may travel.

\subsection{Introduction to Light} \label{SJFjXy}

Light is an amazing and mysterious form of energy. It travels from the Sun to Earth across millions of miles of empty space. When it reaches our planet, light interacts with matter in many ways to generate almost all the energy needed to support life, provide heat, and cause weather patterns. The term \textit{light} usually refers to visible light, which is only one of several types of light. Visible light is one form of electromagnetic radiation, as it occupies a tiny band in the huge range called the electromagnetic spectrum.

\vspace{1em}


What is \gls{emr}? It's a fancy word for all types of light, not just the visible. But it's defined as the radiant energy that consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. What is a field? In physics, a field is like a fluid, but one that you cannot see. The \gls{electric field} tells us the force per unit charge at all locations in space around a charge distribution, and the \gls{magnetic field} shows the directional lines around a magnetic material that indicate the direction and magnitude of the magnetic force. 

\vspace{1em}

Electromagnetic radiation is generated by electric current, or moving charges. (Recall that electric current is defined as electric charges that are moving.) Electric current generates both an electric field ($E$) and a magnetic field ($B$). These fields are perpendicular to each other. When an electric charge oscillates---that is, when it moves back and forth regularly---an electromagnetic (EM) wave is propagated. Such an electromagnetic wave is shown in Figure \ref{oQgjrD}.

Let's recall the following definitions from the previous unit:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-0.5ex}
    \item Wavelength is the distance between two wave crests or troughs, express in units of meters
    \item Frequency is the number of wave crests that pass a point per second, expressed in hertz (Hz)
    \item Amplitude is the height of the crest above the equilibrium line, or null point.
\end{itemize}

As mentioned, electromagnetic radiation takes several forms. These forms are characterized by a range of frequencies. Because frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, any form of EMR can also be represented by its range of wavelengths. Figure \ref{TBWcbi} is the electromagnetic spectrum, which shows the frequency and wavelength ranges of various types of electromagnetic radiation.

\end{center}

Figure \ref{TBWcbi} has many parts. The narrow band that is visible light extends from lower-frequency red light to higher-frequency violet light. Frequencies just below visible are called \textit{infrared} (below red), and those just above are \textit{ultraviolet} (beyond violet).

\vspace{1em}

Radio waves, which are used for media broadcasts of TV and radio signals, occupy frequencies lower than infrared (IR). The microwave radiation is the same radiation that is used in your microwave oven. What we feel as radiant heat on your skin is also a form of low-frequency EMR. The high-frequency radiation to the right of ultraviolet (UV) includes X-rays and gamma ($\gamma$) rays.

\vspace{1em}

All these electromagnetic waves are the same form of radiation. They can all travel across empty space, and they all travel at the speed of light in a vacuum. The basic difference between types of radiation is their differing frequencies. Each frequency has an associated wavelength. Frequency and wavelength are \textit{inversely} proportional: as frequency increases across the spectrum, wavelength decreases. Each frequency also has an associated energy. Frequency and energy are \textit{directly} proportional: as the frequency of a wave increases, the energy also increases. For example, because ultraviolet waves occupy a higher frequency range than do infrared waves, the former carry more energy than the latter.

Visible light is the only region of the electromagnetic spectrum that is perceivable by human eyes. Wavelengths of visible light range from about \SI{380}{nm} (violet) to \SI{750}{nm} (red). The frequencies corresponding to these wavelengths are \SI{4.0e14}{Hz} at the red end to \SI{7.9e14}{Hz} at the violet end. This is a very narrow range, since the EM spectrum spans about 20 orders of magnitude.

Wavelengths of visible light are often given in nanometers (nm), so its useful to know how to convert nanometers to meters. One nanometer is one billionth of a meter (m):
\begin{equation} \label{LLLSU7}
    \SI{1}{nm} = \SI{1}{nanometer} = \SI{1e-9}{m}
\end{equation}

\begin{example}
    Yellow light has a wavelength of about \SI{600}{nm}. Convert this wavelength to meters.
\end{example}

\Solution Using Equation \eqref{LLLSU7}, 600 nanometers is converted to meters as

\begin{equation*}
    \SI{600}{\cancel\nano\meter} \times \frac{\SI{1e-9}{m}}{\SI{1}{\cancel\nano\meter}} = \SI{600e-9}{m} = \SI{6.00e-7}{m}
\end{equation*}

As seen in Figure \ref{lyOjge}, seven colors of the visible spectrum, in order of increasing frequency, are:

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=black!10]
\begin{center}
    \textbf{\hspace{5mm}

How is it that human vision is confined to a tiny sliver of the whole electromagnetic spectrum? Color is detected by cells in the eye called \textit{cones}. Humans have three cones that are sensitive to three different ranges of electromagnetic wavelengths. They are called red, blue, and green cones, although these colors do not correspond exactly to the centers of the three ranges. The ranges of wavelengths that each cone detects are red, 500 to \SI{700}{nm}; green, 450 to \SI{630}{nm}; and blue, 400 to \SI{500}{nm}. Most primates also have three cones, while most non-primate mammals only have two. However, many birds, reptiles, amphibians, and insects have four or five different cones in their eyes. Some animals, like bees, see in ultraviolet, while rattlesnakes can see infrared light!

\vspace{1em}

Visible light also plays a major role in the ecological environment. Nearly all of our food depends on the photosynthesis process in plants. The energy for this process comes from the Sun in visible part of the spectrum. Without photosynthesis, we would also have almost no oxygen in the atmosphere.

\subsection{Low-Frequency Light} \label{8Wb3QO}

We define low-frequency light as electromagnetic waves with frequencies below visible light. The lower the frequency of an EM wave, the longer its wavelength and the lower its energy. Exposure to frequencies below visible light is generally safe. 

\vspace{1em}

Infrared is the region right below visible light. Wavelengths of infrared radiation span from about 750 nanometers to about 1 millimeter (mm). Although the human eye cannot see infrared radiation, the body can sense it. We feel it as heat or warmth, such as when we stand close to a campfire. Infrared waves have applications in heating, thermal imaging cameras heating, and lasers used in treating \href{https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13102818.2018.1544034}{gum disease}. 

\vspace{1em}

Microwaves have lower frequencies than infrared waves, through not as low as radio waves. The most famous application of microwaves is in your (aptly named) microwave oven. This oven cooks or warms food by irradiating it with EM radiation in the microwave frequency range. Most kitchen microwaves use a frequency of \SI{2.45e9}{Hz}. EM waves at this particular frequency have the right amount of energy to cause polar molecules\footnote{Polar molecules are those that have a partial charge separation.}, such as water, to rotate faster. The rotational energy of these molecules is given up to surrounding matter as heat. The end result: your food gets hot.

\vspace{1em}

Another application of microwaves is radar. Radar uses radiation with wavelengths similar to those of microwaves to detect the location and speed of distant objects, such as airplanes, weather formations, and motor vehicles. Radar information is obtained by receiving and analyzing the echoes of microwaves reflected by an object. The speed of the object can be measured using the Doppler shift of the returning waves. Astronomers use this same Doppler effect to measure the speed at which distant galaxies are moving away from us. In fact, in the 1960s, astronomers used these electromagnetic waves to prove that Mercury and Venus rotate and to measure these planets' rotation rates.

\vspace{1em}

Radio waves have the lowest frequencies---and, therefore, longest wavelengths---of the electromagnetic spectrum. Television, radio, cell phone, and remote-control devices all broadcast and/or receive signals with in radio wavelengths. One medical-imaging technique is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is an important imaging and research tool in medicine, producing highly detailed two- and three-dimensional images. Radio waves are broadcast, absorbed, and re-emitted in a resonance process that is sensitive to the density of nuclei, usually hydrogen nuclei---protons.

\subsection{High-Frequency Light} \label{QoTj3l}

We define high-frequency light as electromagnetic waves with frequencies above visible light. Exposure to any radiation with frequencies greater than those of visible light carries some health hazards. All types of radiation in this range are known to cause cell damage. The danger is related to the high energy and penetrating ability of these EM waves. The likelihood of being harmed by any of this radiation depends largely on the amount of exposure. 



\vspace{1em}

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation comes after visible light on the electromagnetic spectrum.  Since \textit{ultra} means extreme or beyond, this region has higher frequencies than violet color. A major source of UV light on Earth is the Sun, though many high-frequency UV rays get absorbed by the atmosphere before they reach the ground. Most people try to reduce exposure to UV radiation from sunlight by using sunscreen and protective clothing. Ultraviolet light has a variety of useful applications. For example, black-lights are used by detectives to see bodily fluids. Also, UV lights may be installed inside air ducts on AC units to kill bacteria on surfaces.  

\vspace{1em}

X-rays have higher frequencies than ultraviolet waves. This type of electromagnetic radiation is widely known for its application in the medical field. Doctors and dentists use X-rays to diagnose medical problems, but the intensity of the radiation used is extremely low and therefore safe. While pregnant women should not be exposed to X-rays, even at low doses, some babies get chest X-rays a few months after birth. Medical X-ray images are possible because of the absorption of X-rays by electrons. Calcium atoms, which are plentiful in teeth and bones, carry lot of electrons for X-ray absorption, more so than carbon, oxygen, and other organic atoms. That's why teeth and bones make excellent X-ray images.

\vspace{1em}

Gamma rays have the highest frequencies of the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Due to their high frequencies, they have the highest energies of all EM waves. In 1986, the core of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor at Pripyat in present-day Ukraine exploded. This disaster was caused by human error and serious flaws in the design of the reactor. The exposed core released enormous amounts of deadly gamma ray radiation. Workers and firefighters who got too close to the open core---several dozen meters away---died from radiation poisoning days or weeks after exposure. To this day, Pripyat is an abandoned city due to the lingering presence of gamma rays. But aside from this rare catastrophe, gamma rays are rarely observed on Earth. While they are generated in tiny amounts during a lighting strike, most gamma rays are generated in high-energy events in distant parts of outer space.

\subsection{The Speed of Light} \label{VDAtHN}

A vacuum is a region of space that is devoid of all matter. For this reason, a vacuum is also known as ``empty space.'' Electromagnetic waves, unlike sound waves or mechanical waves, \textit{can} travel through a vacuum. EM waves travel through empty space, and they also travel through some media, like air, glass, and water. But electromagnetic waves travel fastest through a vacuum, at a rate known as the speed of light:

\begin{equation}
    c = \SI{3.0e8}{m/s}
\end{equation}

The speed of light is the upper limit of speed in the universe, since nothing can travel faster than light.

In a vacuum, all electromagnetic radiation travels at a speed of \SI{3.0e8}{m/s} (671 million miles per hour), which is known as the ``speed of light'' and is given the symbol

\begin{equation*}
    c = \SI{3.0e8}{m/s}
\end{equation*}

When light travels through a physical medium, its speed is always less than the speed of light ($c$).
