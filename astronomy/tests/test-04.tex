\question 
Why are the winter months so cold in Texas? Explain this from an astronomical perspective.
\qspace

\question %5
What are the two ways that the tilt of Earth's axis causes the summers in the United States to be warmer than the winters?
\qspace

\question %21
The term equinox translates as ``equal night.'' Explain why this translation makes sense from an astronomical point of view.
\qspace

\question %22
The term solstice translates as ``Sun stop.'' Explain why this translation makes sense from an astronomical point of view.
\qspace

\question %24
When Earth's Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun during June, some would argue that the cause of our seasons is that the Northern Hemisphere is physically closer to the Sun than the Southern Hemisphere, and this is the primary reason the Northern Hemisphere is warmer. What argument or line of evidence could contradict this idea?
\qspace

\question %26
In countries at far northern latitudes, the winter months tend to be so cloudy that astronomical observations are nearly impossible. Why can't good observations of the stars be made at those places during the summer months?
\qspace
