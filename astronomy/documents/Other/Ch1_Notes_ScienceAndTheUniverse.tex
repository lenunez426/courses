\subsection*{Downloading \textit{Stellarium} at CFISD}

As of August 2022, the \texttt{Ivanti Portal} enabled the download of \texttt{Stellarium v0.14.3}.

\subsection*{Downloading \textit{Stellarium} Independently}
Download \textit{Stellarium} from \href{https://stellarium.org/}{stellarium.org} and install it on your computer.

When you open it, it's possible that the resolution of the GUI is too low---that is, the windows appear excessively zoomed in. This issue is fixed as follows. In the Windows search box, search for and open the program called \texttt{Command Prompt}. In the \texttt{Command Prompt}, type the following line and hit enter:

\begin{center}
    \verb|"C:\Program Files\Stellarium\stellarium.exe" --scale-gui 0.75 -platform windows:altgr|
\end{center}

Hitting enter should boot the program with a more appropriate GUI scale factor.
