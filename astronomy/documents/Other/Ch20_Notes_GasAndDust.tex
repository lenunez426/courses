    name=nebula,
    description={a cloud of interstellar gas or dust; the term is most often used for clouds that are seen to glow with visible light or infrared}
}

\newglossaryentry{interstellar dust}{
    name=interstellar dust,
    description={tiny solid grains in interstellar space thought to consist of a core of rocklike material (silicates) or graphite surrounded by a mantle of ices; water, methane, and ammonia are probably the most abundant ices}

\newglossaryentry{molecular cloud}{
    name=molecular cloud,
    description={a large, dense, cold interstellar cloud; because of its size and density, this type of cloud can keep ultraviolet radiation from reaching its interior, where molecules are able to form}

    name=reddening (interstellar),
    description={the reddening of starlight passing through interstellar dust because dust scatters blue light more effectively than red}
