Jean Twenge believes textbooks should not be eliminated in the classroom but be shorter and cover less breadth and more depth. This document will include a highly truncated version of Openstax Chapter 5 of Astronomy 2e. The goal of this document is to enable students to continue reading and critically thinking about the text; to maintain students fully embedded in a ``printed'' culture of classroom learning. Although this document will necessarily be shorter than what is available on OpenStax chapter 5, its brevity will hopefully incentivize students to learn via the medium of the printed word, the best medium according to Neil Postman. This document should include questions that check for understanding and point their focus in the direction of the main ideas.

To do: Create ``Read the following passage'' questions.
